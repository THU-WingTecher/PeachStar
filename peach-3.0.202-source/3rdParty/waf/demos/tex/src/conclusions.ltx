\section{Conclusions}

Hopefully, the text will create a sensible PostScript or \acronym{PDF} document.  That choice is
made in the wscript file in this directory.  It perhas needs making into a command line option.
Also there should be the possiblity of making both PostScript and \acronym{PDF} on the same run
-- at least if generating \acronym{PDF} from \acronym{DVI}.
