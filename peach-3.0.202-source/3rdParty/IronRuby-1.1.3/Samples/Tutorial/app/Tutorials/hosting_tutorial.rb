    introduction %{
        One of the top DLR features is common hosting support for all languages implemented on the DLR. The 
        primary goal is supporting .NET applications hosting the DLR languages for scripting support so that
        users can extend the basic functionality of the host application using any (DLR) language of their
        choice, irrespective of the programming language used to implement the host appplication.
    }

    section "Hosting" do
        introduction %{
            A quick survey of functionality includes:
            * Create ScriptRuntimes locally or in remote app domains.
            * Execute snippets of code.
            * Execute files of code in their own execution context (ScriptScope).
            * Explicitly choose language engines to use or just execute files to let the DLR find the right engine.
            * Create scopes privately or publicly for executing code in.
            * Create scopes, set variables in the scope to provide host object models, and publish the scopes for dynamic languages to import, require, etc.
            * Create scopes, set variables to provide object models, and execute code within the scopes.
            * Fetch dynamic objects and functions from scopes bound to names or execute expressions that return objects.
            * Call dynamic functions as host command implementations or event handlers.
            * Get reflection information for object members, parameter information, and documentation.
            * Control how files are resolved when dynamic languages import other files of code.
    
            Hosts always start by calling statically on the ScriptRuntime to create a ScriptRuntime. In the 
            simplest case, the host can set globals and execute files that access the globals.  In more advanced 
            scenarios, hosts can fully control language engines, get services from them, work with compiled code, 
            explicitly execute code in specific scopes, interact in rich ways with dynamic objects from the 
            ScriptRuntime, and so on.

            A detailed specification of the hosting APIs is available at 
            http://www.codeplex.com/dlr/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Docs%20and%20specs.

                    are using a different language to implement the host, the method name would be
                    <tt>IronRuby.Ruby.CreateEngine</tt>. You will also have to make sure to add a 
                    reference to IronRuby.dll. This is done using the <tt>/r</tt> command-line compiler
                    option for C# and VB.Net, or using the <tt>clr.AddReference</tt> method from IronPython.

                host application. The tutorial application you are using stores the tutorials as

                Creating a ScriptEngine provides isolation of the host application and user script
                code. However, it is often useful to have isolation within the ScriptEngine. For
                example, multiple scripts might happen to use the same variable name. Normally,
                local variables defined in different .rb files are isolated from each other.
                The same effect can be achieved by creating multiple instances of +ScriptScope+,
                which more or less corresponds to a .rb file.
