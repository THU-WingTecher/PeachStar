Development notes:

 - Trying out a replacement for the PIN Tool
   - Use pyew to identify basic blocks
   - Set breakpoints using a debugger

   - Status: HandleLoadDll event callback is not hitting
       so we are unable to set breakpoints.

       Basic block finding seems to be working but is not validated.
       Currently it is not also getting bb from dll dependencies.
